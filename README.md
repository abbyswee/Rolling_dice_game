This program is uses C++ and it is a rolling the dice game, the program has a lot 
of input validation which forces the player say that they have 2 players and say 
that they want to play the game. If the player says no to either question the 
program exits. However, if they both respond that they want to play the program
keeps track of the points each player has and stops when one player reaches 100 
and beats the other player. Then the program starts/add to an outfile for the 
winner data. It will also loop around again and ask if you want to play again, 
and it will continue to do so until you either don't have 2 players or you want
to stop playing.
